# TODOs:

- Create GENERAL logs file with WARNINGs and ERRORs: easy way to register and find bugs.
- Async method to continuously read proxies.
- General architecture: clean folders and files.
- [WIP - 20/03/2022] Web scraper: search page step is too slow.
- [WIP - 20/03/2022] Data extractor: find duplicates methods are too slow.
- DATA EXTRACTOR: must be the unique point between database (MARIADB and cache) and web scraper, files, page mappers, etc.
- cochesNet_api: data mapper must be linked to ORM (same maps) -> At the moment, two transformations are needed.
- Web scraper: improve timing logs
